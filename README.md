# 📚 Library Management System using SQL

## 📌 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a **Library Management System** using SQL that effectively tracks book availability, 
Employee borrowing activity, and members operations. This system simulates the core functionalities of a real-world library database.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**
- **MySQL** (or any relational DBMS)
- SQL DDL & DML queries
- Joins, Aggregations, Subqueries

## 🗂️ Database Schema

The project contains the following tables:

- `Library`: Contains library details
- `Books`: Stores book information including author and quantity
- `branch`: Maintains branch records
- `Members`: Maintains members records
- `Employees`: Maintains employee records
- `IssueStatus`: Logs book issue and return status
- `ReturnStatus`: Records late returns and fines

## 🔍 Key SQL Queries Implemented

- Create and populate tables with sample data
- Fetch list of all available books
- Identify employees who have borrowed books
- Calculate total fine paid by students
- Track book return status and delays
- Identify staff who issued the maximum number of books

## 📈 Key Insights & Findings

- Tracked overdue books and associated fines to evaluate student borrowing behavior.
- Identified popular books based on the frequency of issues.
- Determined top-performing staff based on the number of books issued.
- Designed robust queries for data retrieval, joining multiple tables for meaningful insights.

## ✅ Outcome

This project enhances understanding of SQL database design, relationships, and complex query building for a real-world library system simulation. It's a strong foundation for anyone looking to pursue careers in **Data Analytics**, **Database Management**, or **Backend Development**.
